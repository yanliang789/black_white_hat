```markdown
- Hard to understand and read
- Miss leading label for X-Axis: Not true which state or which country the counties belong.
- Miss leading label for X-Axis: Not true which state or which country the counties belong.
- Miss leading label for Y-Axis: Cannot understand what’s the meaning of education, is it for high school, college, or master? What’s the meaning of the legends? Percentage or number of people?
- Bad color of the bar chart Since the figure only talks about education, using a sequential scale will be much better.
- What the Education level means here. Is it going to talk about different kinds of education levels here or not?
- I don't know where the data comes from and how to process the data.
- There is no evidence about where the county_demographics.csv comes from and how it was collected and where it was found.![image](https://user-

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yanliang789/black_white_hate/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
