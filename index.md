- The visualization is for comparison, using a bar chart is much easier than a spread pie chart.
- Included a zero baseline is much clearer, the scale is easy to read.
- With tooltip with bar chart easy and efficient to visualize.

### Black Hat
[Black Hat Block](https://bl.ocks.org/yanliang789/75ea984109906138aca39b6d7d82f9b3)

```markdown
**Reason**
- Hard to understand and read
- Miss leading label for X-Axis: Not true which state or which country the counties belong.
- Miss leading label for Y-Axis: Cannot understand what’s the meaning of education, is it for high school, college, or master? What’s the meaning of the legends? Percentage or number of people?
- Bad color of the bar chart Since the figure only talks about education, using a sequential scale will be much better.
- What the Education level means here. Is it going to talk about different kinds of education levels here or not?
- I don't know where the data comes from and how to process the data.
- There is no evidence about where the county_demographics.csv comes from and how it was collected and where it was found.

```markdown
**Reason**
- The visual representation with clear X-Axis and Y-xis easy to understand.
- The notation with pink mark, easy to draw the viewer's read.
- The data are download from Kaggle pick the data time from 2000 to 2015, rename column 'dt' to 'date' for convenience.
- The data source link is as above, I also site the source code in my block.
